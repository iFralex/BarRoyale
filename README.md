# Bar Royale
This Unity project is a game concept prototype commissioned by a graphic designer in spring 2021. It was designed for mobile devices and inspired by Brawl Stars, featuring top-down single-player combat gameplay. Although it initially planned to have multiplayer features, development was halted before their implementation. The prototype offers responsive multitouch controls, a functional UI, and dynamic weapons, serving as a foundation for a top-down shooter.

## Unity
This complete game concept prototype was developed using the Unity game engine, which provides a versatile environment for creating interactive experiences. It was designed to be a full-fledged game ready for publication on app stores.

The core gameplay of the project focused on a single-player experience. Players were meant to engage in dynamic top-down combat, drawing inspiration from the popular mobile game Brawl Stars, even though the original plans included a multiplayer component.

The game featured an array of gameplay elements, including:
- **Input System**: The prototype leverages multitouch capabilities for both movement and aiming, offering responsive controls.
- **Weapon System**: A comprehensive weapon system allows players to choose, switch between, and fire various weapons. This system includes enemy elimination, receiving and causing damage, shooting animations, the aiming display, and different types of weapons: Katana, shotgun, hunting riflee, and crossbow.
- **Collecting Items System**: A system has been developed for collecting various objects: weapons, life, and shields. The system is easily extensible to pick up other items with other functions.
- **UI Functionality**: The game incorporates a fully functioning user interface. This includes health and shield bars, slots to represent the weapons you have collected, the shield items available, and the life items available; then a complete minimap system and other working menus.

## Development Progress
Originally envisioned as a fully publishable game with multiplayer capabilities, development came to a halt in the spring of 2021. The project was commissioned by a graphic designer who intended to create the game's visuals. However, due to time constraints, the development could not proceed, leaving the prototype without complete features and the necessary resources for release on distribution platforms.
